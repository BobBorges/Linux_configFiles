# bash aliases

## Description

These are bash aliases that I uses. Some are useful. Some are just funny.

For additions to take effect, run 

    $ exec bash 

or reboot.

## Contents

* .bash_aliases

## Location

:  ~/

Note: There should also be

    if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
        . ~/.bash_aliases
    fi

in the `.bashrc` file. Otherwise, copy the contents of `.bash_aliases` directly into the `.bashrc` file.
